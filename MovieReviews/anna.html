      <h2>FrameDeer Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="thoughts-content">
        <div class="thoughts-text">
          <p><strong>Luc Besson returns to familiar territory</strong> with this stylish action thriller that combines elements of his previous successes like La Femme Nikita and Lucy. Anna delivers the sleek visual style and kinetic action sequences that Besson fans have come to expect, while attempting to put a fresh spin on the female assassin genre through its complex narrative structure and timeline manipulation.</p>
          
          <p>The film's most distinctive feature is its non-linear storytelling, which uses multiple timeline jumps to reveal new layers of Anna's story and motivations. While this approach creates some intriguing twists and surprises, it occasionally feels more like a structural gimmick than an organic storytelling choice. The constant temporal shifts can be disorienting, though they do serve to emphasize Anna's strategic mind and ability to stay several steps ahead of everyone around her.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Sasha Luss makes</strong> a compelling feature film debut as the titular character, bringing both physical presence and emotional depth to the role. As a former model, Luss convincingly portrays Anna's dual life as both fashion icon and deadly operative. Her background in modeling serves the character well, particularly in scenes that require her to use her beauty and poise as weapons alongside her physical combat skills.</p>
          
          <p>The supporting cast adds considerable weight to the production, with Helen Mirren and Luke Evans delivering strong performances as the competing intelligence handlers. Cillian Murphy brings his characteristic intensity to the role of a CIA operative, though his character feels somewhat underutilized given the actor's capabilities. The chemistry between the characters helps ground the more outlandish elements of the plot.</p>
          
          <p>Where Anna truly excels is in its action sequences. Besson's signature style shines through in the well-choreographed fight scenes and stylish set pieces. The film doesn't shy away from brutal, practical action, and the combat feels visceral and impactful. The contrast between the glamorous world of high fashion and the gritty reality of espionage creates some memorable visual moments.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> A stylish if somewhat derivative action thriller that delivers solid entertainment for fans of the genre. While it may not reach the heights of Besson's classic works, Anna offers enough visual flair and intriguing twists to make for an engaging viewing experience.</p>

      <h2>The Making of Anna</h2>
      <div class="making-content">
        <div class="making-text">
          <p><strong>Luc Besson's vision for Anna</strong> was to create a modern take on the female assassin genre that he helped popularize with La Femme Nikita. The director wanted to explore similar themes of identity, agency, and transformation, but with a more complex narrative structure and contemporary sensibilities. Besson saw the project as an opportunity to blend his signature action style with a more intricate plot that would keep audiences guessing.</p>
          
          <p>Sasha Luss's casting was central to Besson's concept for the film. As a former high-fashion model, Luss brought authentic experience to Anna's cover identity as a fashion model. However, the role required extensive physical training to transform her into a believable action heroine. Luss underwent months of combat training, learning various martial arts and weapons handling to perform many of her own stunts. Her background in ballet provided a strong foundation for the physical demands of the role.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The film's non-linear structure</strong> was a deliberate creative choice to emphasize Anna's strategic mind and the theme of manipulation. Besson and his editors worked carefully to ensure that the timeline jumps would create maximum impact while remaining coherent. The structure allows for several major plot twists that recontextualize earlier scenes, though some critics argued this approach occasionally felt contrived.</p>
          
          <p>Production took place across multiple European locations to create the film's international scope. The contrast between the glamorous Parisian fashion world and the gritty Russian settings was carefully designed to highlight Anna's dual existence. The action sequences were choreographed to feel visceral and practical, with an emphasis on hand-to-hand combat rather than relying heavily on CGI.</p>
          
          <p>Despite facing competition from other female-led action films released around the same time, Anna distinguished itself through its European sensibility and Besson's distinctive visual style. The film's moderate budget allowed for creative freedom while maintaining the production values expected of a Besson action thriller.</p>
