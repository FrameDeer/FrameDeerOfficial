      <h2>FrameDeer Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="thoughts-content">
        <div class="thoughts-text">
          <p><strong>The Spy Who Loved Me represents the pinnacle of Roger Moore's tenure as James Bond</strong>, perfectly balancing the series' signature blend of action, humor, and spectacle. Following two less successful entries, this film reinvigorated the franchise with grand-scale ambition, innovative set pieces, and a confident execution that makes it one of the most entertaining Bond adventures ever made.</p>
          
          <p>The film's greatest achievement lies in its spectacular set pieces, each more ambitious than the last. From the breathtaking pre-title ski jump off a mountain to the epic underwater battles and the climactic destruction of Stromberg's tanker, the film delivers one iconic sequence after another. Director Lewis Gilbert, returning after You Only Live Twice, demonstrates masterful control of large-scale action filmmaking while maintaining character-driven moments.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Roger Moore's performance as James Bond</strong> finds the perfect balance between the character's traditional suaveness and Moore's natural wit. This is Moore at his most comfortable and charismatic in the role, delivering one-liners with perfect timing while maintaining the necessary seriousness during dramatic moments. His chemistry with Barbara Bach creates one of the franchise's most compelling partnerships.</p>
          
          <p>Barbara Bach's Anya Amasova stands as one of the strongest and most capable Bond women. As a skilled KGB agent and Bond's equal in every respect, she represents a significant evolution from earlier female characters in the series. The tension created by her personal vendetta against Bond adds emotional depth to their relationship, making their eventual romance feel earned and meaningful.</p>
          
          <p>Richard Kiel's Jaws instantly became one of cinema's most memorable henchmen. His nearly indestructible steel-toothed assassin provides a physical threat that feels genuinely dangerous, creating several tense and inventive action sequences. The character's popularity would see him return in the next film, a rare honor for a Bond villain's henchman.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> A near-perfect example of classic Bond filmmaking that delivers everything fans love about the series. Spectacular action, memorable characters, and pure entertainment from start to finish.</p>

      <h2>The Making of The Spy Who Loved Me</h2>
      <div class="making-content">
        <div class="making-text">
          <p><strong>The Spy Who Loved Me faced significant production challenges</strong> that nearly derailed the project before filming even began. Following the disappointing reception of The Man with the Golden Gun, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were determined to create a Bond film that would restore the franchise to its former glory. The result was the most ambitious and expensive Bond production to date, featuring groundbreaking special effects and unprecedented scale.</p>
          
          <p>The film's most iconic element, the Lotus Esprit submarine car, required extensive engineering and testing. Six Esprits were converted for filming, with one fully functional submarine car built at a cost of over $100,000. The underwater sequences were filmed in the Bahamas with specially designed camera housings and required months of preparation. The car's transformation from road vehicle to submarine remains one of the most memorable gadget reveals in franchise history.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Rick Sylvester's legendary ski jump</strong> opening sequence nearly didn't happen. After initial tests with a stunt double proved unsatisfactory, professional skier Sylvester was hired to perform the death-defying jump off Mount Asgard in Canada. The stunt was performed with no second takes possible, and Sylvester's successful jump provided one of the most breathtaking openings in action cinema history. The sequence was so impressive that it earned a round of applause from the crew when first screened.</p>
          
          <p>Ken Adam's production design reached new heights of ambition with Stromberg's underwater lair and massive supertanker set. The tanker interior was the largest soundstage set ever built at Pinewood Studios at the time, requiring innovative engineering to accommodate the complex action sequences. Adam's futuristic vision for Stromberg's headquarters created a memorable villain's lair that perfectly complemented the film's grand scale.</p>
