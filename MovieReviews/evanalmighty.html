          <p class="description">Freshman Congressman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) has left his Buffalo news career behind to make a difference in Washington, D.C. But his plans take a bizarre turn when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and commands him to build an ark in preparation for a great flood. Despite his initial skepticism and the threat to his political career, Evan finds himself growing a beard at supernatural speed and attracting animals in pairs. As his family and colleagues question his sanity, Evan must embrace his unlikely mission and convince everyone that the flood is coming, all while dealing with a corrupt Congressman (John Goodman) who wants to destroy the environment for profit.</p>

      <h2>FrameDeer Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="thoughts-content">
        <div class="thoughts-text">
          <p><strong>Tom Shadyac's follow-up to Bruce Almighty</strong> attempts to blend family-friendly comedy with biblical epic, but struggles to find the right balance between the two tones. While the film has its heart in the right place and delivers some genuine laughs, it ultimately feels overproduced and lacking the sharp comedic edge that made Steve Carell's original supporting role in Bruce Almighty so memorable.</p>
          
          <p>The film's strongest element is undoubtedly Steve Carell's committed performance as the increasingly bewildered Evan Baxter. Carell brings his signature comedic timing and everyman charm to the role, making Evan's transformation from ambitious politician to reluctant ark-builder both funny and surprisingly touching. His physical comedy, particularly as he deals with his rapidly growing beard and the constant attention from animals, provides the film's most consistent laughs.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Morgan Freeman returns</strong> as God, bringing his customary warmth and gravitas to the role. His chemistry with Carell creates some of the film's better moments, particularly their conversations about faith, purpose, and what it means to "change the world." The supporting cast, including Lauren Graham as Evan's patient wife and John Goodman as the villainous Congressman, do solid work with material that often feels underdeveloped.</p>
          
          <p>Where the film struggles is in its execution of the biblical epic elements. The ark-building sequences and eventual flood feel overly reliant on CGI that hasn't aged particularly well. The environmental message, while well-intentioned, often comes across as heavy-handed. At 96 minutes, the film feels both rushed and overstuffed, never quite finding the right rhythm for its ambitious premise.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> A well-intentioned but uneven comedy that delivers some laughs and heartwarming moments but ultimately fails to live up to its predecessor's legacy. While families may find it entertaining enough, it lacks the sharp wit and consistent comedy that would make it truly memorable.</p>

      <h2>The Making of Evan Almighty</h2>
      <div class="making-content">
        <div class="making-text">
          <p><strong>The film holds the distinction</strong> of being the most expensive comedy ever made at the time of its release, with a budget of $175 million. Much of this cost went toward the extensive visual effects, animal training, and the massive ark set that was constructed in Virginia. The ark itself was built to biblical specifications - 300 cubits long (about 450 feet), 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high - making it one of the largest practical sets ever constructed for a comedy film.</p>
          
          <p>Steve Carell underwent a significant physical transformation for the role, growing an actual beard that was then enhanced with prosthetics as the film progressed. The animal sequences required extensive training and coordination, with over 200 species of animals used throughout production. The production worked with animal trainers from around the world to ensure the safety and comfort of both the animals and the cast.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The environmental themes</strong> were a conscious choice by the filmmakers, who wanted to create a family-friendly film with a positive message about stewardship and conservation. The production itself attempted to be environmentally conscious, with claims of being the "first carbon-neutral comedy" through various offset measures. However, these claims were later questioned by environmental groups.</p>
          
          <p>Despite its massive budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment, failing to recoup its production costs during its theatrical run. The high costs were attributed to extensive reshoots, visual effects work, and marketing expenses. The film's performance led to significant changes in how studios budgeted and marketed comedies in subsequent years.</p>
