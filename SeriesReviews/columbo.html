          <p class="description">A revolutionary detective series that inverted the classic whodunit formula. Each episode begins by showing the murder and the killer's identity, then follows Lieutenant Columbo - a seemingly disheveled, absent-minded LAPD homicide detective - as he methodically unravels the perfect crime through relentless questioning and attention to minute details.</p>

      <h2>FrameDeer Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="thoughts-content">
        <div class="thoughts-text">
          <p><strong>Columbo represents one of television's most brilliant detective creations</strong>, a series that completely redefined the crime drama genre by showing audiences the "howcatchem" rather than the whodunit. Peter Falk's portrayal of the rumpled, seemingly bumbling Lieutenant Columbo remains one of the most iconic and enduring characters in television history.</p>
          
          <p>The series' genius lies in its inverted mystery structure. Unlike traditional detective shows where the audience tries to guess the killer alongside the detective, Columbo reveals the murderer and their methods in the opening act. The suspense then builds from watching Columbo's meticulous, almost psychological dissection of the perfect crime. His trademark "just one more thing" becomes the verbal trapdoor through which killers inevitably fall.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Peter Falk's performance</strong> is nothing short of masterful. His Columbo appears deceptively simple - a disorganized man in a wrinkled raincoat driving a beat-up Peugeot - yet beneath this facade lies one of television's sharpest intellects. Falk brings warmth, humor, and relentless determination to the role, creating a character who feels genuinely human rather than a superhuman detective.</p>
          
          <p>The series features an incredible roster of guest stars as the killers, including legendary actors like Jack Cassidy, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Johnny Cash. These antagonists are typically wealthy, sophisticated professionals who believe they've committed the perfect crime, making Columbo's working-class methodology all the more satisfying when he exposes their arrogance and flaws.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Columbo's investigative technique</strong> is a study in psychological warfare. He plays the fool to lull killers into false confidence, then methodically chips away at their alibis through seemingly innocent questions and observations. His approach demonstrates that the smallest details - a mismatched wine bottle, an incorrect time notation, a misplaced object - can unravel even the most elaborate criminal schemes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> A timeless masterpiece of detective fiction that continues to influence crime dramas decades after its debut. Columbo's unique formula, combined with Peter Falk's unforgettable performance, creates television that remains as compelling and brilliant today as when it first aired.</p>

      <h2>The Making of Columbo</h2>
      <div class="making-content">
        <div class="making-text">
          <p><strong>The creation of Columbo</strong> began with writers Richard Levinson and William Link, who first introduced the character in a 1960 episode of "The Chevy Mystery Show" and later in the 1962 play "Prescription: Murder." The character was inspired by Porfiry Petrovich from Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" and the detective stories of G.K. Chesterton.</p>
          
          <p>The iconic character almost wasn't played by Peter Falk. The network initially wanted Bing Crosby for the role, but Crosby declined. Falk, who was initially hesitant about television commitment, eventually accepted after being convinced by the quality of the writing and the uniqueness of the character.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Columbo's distinctive look</strong> was largely Peter Falk's creation. The rumpled raincoat was Falk's own, purchased for $15 at a New York department store. The Peugeot 403 convertible became as iconic as the character himself, representing Columbo's everyman quality amidst the wealthy environments he often investigated.</p>
          
          <p>The series pioneered the "inverted mystery" format, showing the murder at the beginning and focusing on the cat-and-mouse game between Columbo and the killer. This structure allowed for deeper character development and psychological complexity, as audiences understood both the detective's methods and the killer's motivations.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The famous "just one more thing"</strong> catchphrase was reportedly ad-libbed by Falk during early filming. The directors recognized its effectiveness in disarming both the suspects and the audience, and it became a signature element of Columbo's deceptive, methodical interrogation style.</p>
